Titan Javascript Controls
Titan is an ever expanding collection of javascript controls I have written to extend the typical or basic functionality of common HTML input elements, and to envision completely new controls in some cases.  These were built for specific projects of mine and I have found them to be useful as a base for each new project.  From a style perspective they can be adjusted to fit your own project and functionality if necessary can easily be adjusted as well.  Hopefully these controls provide a useful starting point to new projects for others as they have for me.  I will be continuing to add more controls that I have built on a regular basis. 

- requires jquery
- requires lowpro.jquery (for javascript OO support)

Controls:
- Dropdown Control
-- support for images and autocomplete

- Button Control
-- standard button replacement, available for expansion into more dynamic control

- Spiderweb Control
-- canvas visualization giving a graphical representation to compare counts across various elements
http://css3pie.com is used for IE8 support.  Make sure PIE.htc exists as the path specified in spiderweb.js.  Update if necessary.  Also excanvas.min.js is required for IE8 canvas support.

- Toggle Control
-- simple on/off switch like toggle

- Grouping Control
-- groups together a group of toggles

*** see index.html for usage examples of each control
